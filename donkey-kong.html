				<h3><strong>Donkey Kong</strong></h3>
				<h5>Released in 1981 by Nintendo</h5>
				<p class="links">Donkey Kong was, and still is, the king of arcade games. Not only was the game one 
					of, if not the first modern 2D platforming game, it also introduced characters such as Donkey Kong
					Mario (then known as "Jumpman") who are still on top today. The game itself was simple in premise: 
					climb to the top of the tower and save the girl, all while avoiding Donkey Kong's attacks.</p>
				<p> Donkey Kong launched Nintendo to the market dominance they still have today. It also sparked two 
					direct sequels: Donkey Kong Jr. (featuring Mario as the antagonist) and Donkey Kong 3, released in 1982 and 1983 respectively.</p>
